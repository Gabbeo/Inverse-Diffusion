# Inverse-Diffusion

This is the code for our bachelor's thesis at KTH (course code SA114X/EF112X).
The process of performing the inverse diffusion with options of plotting and source localization and counting is done as following: first the InverseDiffusion.py script is run, then the Plot.py script is run if you want the plots and then finally the Detection.py script is run if you want the source count.
